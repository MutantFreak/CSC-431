fslex Chris Smith's Blog gives nearly working code. need to add compatibility dll to get it closer to working

1) ~clements/FSharp.PowerPack.1.9.9.9/bin/

- fslex.exe executible which willa uto tranlsate an fsharp specification into an executible file
   mono fslex.exe (our fsl file)
- FSharp.PowerPack.dll
- FSharp.PowerPack.Compatibility.dll

2) changes to fsl file:
add "module Lexer"
change "open Lexing" into "open Microsoft.FSharp.Compatibility.Ocaml.Lexing"


compile this code, get it to work, build our own set of tokens
