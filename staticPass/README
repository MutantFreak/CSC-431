Our feelings about this project are roughly summed up by the following face:  =S
We felt like we lacked the time necessary to fully implement all the features we were supposed to implement.
Our program currently does not support four types of exp's: LetExp, LetRecExp, SetExp, and AppExp.

Our makefile is available to be used. When compiling, you can say "make", "make clean", "make test", or "make run".
"make test" tests our flattenBegins function and shows that it works.
"make run" tests our function which walks the AST, and prints out the frame counter and offset within a given frame where a variable is being placed, and again when the variable is referenced.
