Tag Bits:
00 - int
01 - double
10 - bool or void
11 - pointer
110 - bool
0110 - false bool
1110 - true bool
010 - void

  ** = we don't care / know about those bits. we're talking about the next 2 bits above the **.
01** - string (Clements)
10** - closure (our decision)

Things we're unsure about:
In variableCreation.s, why do we do this? We store the number 1 into the first i64 field of the strobj
	// put a reference to the first field of the strobj into reg_39
	%reg_39 = getelementptr %strobj* %reg_38, i32 0, i32 0
	// put 1 into the 0th field of that strobj
	store i64 1, i64* %reg_39
